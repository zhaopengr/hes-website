***Abstract***: Plastic products have been used worldwide, meanwhile, due to the long degradation time, plastic pollution has become a global environmental issue. Plasticizer (e.g. phthalates) and other organic additives (e.g. Bisphenol A) are accompanied during the production of plastics products. Those compounds can transmit into the atmosphere, and adsorb on small particles from plastic debris. However, the atmospheric degradation processes of those compounds are still not clear, which will increase the health risk of increased toxicity, when the chemical structure changes for the degradation product. In this proposal, two main methods are proposed in order to address on this question: sampling atmospheric particles in order to see whether plasticizer and organic additives exist in the air, and investigate the atmospheric degradation rate of those compounds. This project aims to study the fate of plastic additives in the atmosphere and give evaluations of the atmospheric behavior.
