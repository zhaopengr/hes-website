Status: Approved

We are glad to announce that this project has been approved and funded.

We are recruiting three students for this project. They are responsible for gas tube installation, electronic hardware installation, and Arduino programming, respectively. Thus, candidates with backgrounds in electronic engineering, software engineering, and environmental sciences are expected, respectively. Teamwork experience is very important, as they must deeply collaborate with each other about their ideas, comments, and progresses at each step.

## Development of an automatic controlling module for greenhouse gas online measurements

### Abstract

Global warming is driven by greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere. The emissions and absorptions in ecosystems are important processes for the balance of ambient GHGs. Recently we have developed new condition-regulated ecological chambers for conducting experiments with controlled air conditions, plant species, and soil types, while we need an automatic controlling module which can work with our gas analyzer for continuous GHG measurement. This project will develop the controlling module, which integrates a microcontroller and multiple solenoid valves for measuring gaseous methane, carbon dioxide, and water vapor. It will be used in further research on the exchange of GHGs between ecosystems and the atmosphere.

### Anticipated Research Outcomes

This study will provide an integrated automatic system for continuously labor-free measurement of GHGs, which will be used in further studies on the regulations of GHG emissions/absorptions by plants and soils. It will help conduct experiments for analyzing the contributions of ecosystems to the global warming and climate change.

### Student Learning Outcomes and Benefits to Students 

The students will:

1. learn the theories and principles in soil science and atmospheric science,

2. learn how to do a research design and how to apply it into practice,

3. gain hands-on experiences of both hardware and software development in lab and field, and

4. learn practical skills in data sampling, analysis, visualization, and presentation.

The students will be benefitted in this project with:

1. the opportunity of conducting a real research,

2. work experience in an academic group,

3. the potential development of their future study and work. 

### Statement of Staff Availability

Both supervisors will be available on campus during the project implementation period (10 weeks). At the beginning of the project, the supervisors will give intensive guides for the usage of the devices. The supervisors will provide weekly office hours for regular meetings and discussions. The students are encouraged to contact the supervisors via email and telephone. They can make appointments with the supervisors whenever necessary.
