## OVERVIEW

The BSc in Environmental Science programme gives you an understanding of the natural world and environmental problems caused by development. The programme combines biology, chemistry, earth sciences, mathematical, statistical and GIS methods into one subject. Specialized teams of experts work in biogeochemistry and environmental chemistry; soil, plant and animal ecology; and physical geography and geomorphology.

You will learn to apply problem-solving skills to some of the greatest challenges facing humanity today. Furthermore, you will gain field skills through participating in international field trips in coastal and mountain environments, learning about surveying and interviewing key community stakeholders.

### WHY SHOULD I STUDY ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AT XJTLU?

- Use a hands-on approach to learn the science of environmental processes at a range of scales, from local and regional to national and global
- Gain knowledge from research-led teaching with emphasis on research in areas where humanity faces severe challenges, such as biodiversity loss, climate change and disruption of the earthâ€™s chemical cycles
- Uncover the complexities in environmental decision-making and discover ways to engage in environmental management as you gain insights from industry leaders and non-governmental organizations
- Take advantage of new purpose-built laboratories (20 million RMB) designed to support lab practicals and undergraduate research and learn sophisticated laboratory techniques and data analysis, such as use of Geographical Information Systems
- Earn two degrees: an XJTLU degree from the Chinese Ministry of Education and a globally recognized degree from the University of Liverpool, a member of the Russell Group of leading UK universities.
