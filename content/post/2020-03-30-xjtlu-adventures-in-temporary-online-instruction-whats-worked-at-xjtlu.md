<p><i>Second in a two-part series. <a href="https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/news/2020/03/making-emergency-online-classes-work-we-did-it-you-can-too">Part one here.</a> </i></p><p><img src="https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/assets/images/news/2020/03/online_teaching_and_learning_1_s.jpg"></p><p><i>Dr Chun Zhao, XJTLU's Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering</i></p><p>After stepping off into the unknown of emergency, all-online teaching a month ago, educators at Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University report that module objectives are being achieved and future onsite classes may never be the same.</p><p>What was the key to this success? Instructors interviewed noted they carefully considered content delivery and adjusted learning plans accordingly.<br></p><p>When planning his module, Dr Chun Zhao of XJTLU’s <a href="study/departments/academic-departments/electrical-and-electronic-engineering/">Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering</a> took a leaf from the students’ book.</p><p>“I researched the technology, entertainment and communication methods popular with young people.  I have incorporated elements of these in my online delivery of a technology course to make the module lively and engaging,” he said. <br></p><p>Students’ familiarity with livestreaming helped Dr Cheng-Hung Lo, of the University’s <a href="study/departments/school-of-film-and-tv-arts/">School of Film and TV Arts</a>, make his decision to deliver classes live rather than record in advance.</p><p>“I chose to go with live sessions rather than recorded video - most of our students were born in the digital era and are accustomed to watching live broadcast on social networks and video sharing platforms.  I find it closer to the physical classroom teaching experience. You can improvise a bit, go with the flow, and talk more naturally.  There’s also still a real-time connection with the students, even though it is virtual,” he said. <br></p><p>There’s a different rhythm to account for with online instruction compared to onsite, instructors noted.</p><p>“We have to consider the order of contact and the order of response,” said Dr Anna Y. Tian of XJTLU’s <a href="study/departments/international-business-school-suzhou/">International Business School Suzhou</a>.<br></p><p>“I can no longer see students’ faces in person or walk up to them to ask what they think, and in the virtual environment they need to take turns responding to a question I might pose.  However, by redesigning the course to take advantage of the online techniques we have been provided, the learning outcomes are achieved,” she said.</p><p>Both Dr Eduardo Medina of XJTLU’s <a href="study/departments/academic-departments/health-and-environmental-sciences/">Department of Health and Environmental Sciences</a> and Professor Roberto Donà of International Business School Suzhou have found benefits in combining ways for students to learn on their own and at the same time.<br></p><p> “The online mode of teaching relies more on students’ independent learning,” said Dr Medina.</p><p>“Therefore, I restructured what were previously face-to-face lectures into both synchronous and asynchronous activities to guide this independent learning,” he said.<br></p><p>"At the beginning of the week, students read materials in advance of a lecture and then discuss and exchange views in online study group forums.  In the middle of the week, they watch a pre-recorded lecture.  At the end of the week, we have synchronous discussions and exchanges, arriving at common conclusions or summaries of the offline activities."</p><p>Professor Donà also asks students to study material for his masters level module offline – both text and video clips – and then answer questions or take quizzes on the learning platform in preparation for later synchronous discussion. <br></p><p>”I don’t use the virtual classroom to deliver content, I use it to discuss content,” he said.</p><p>“The students are obliged to study to prepare themselves and we have the entire virtual class period to discuss. By combining synchronous and asynchronous classes, I am not just replacing the physical class, I can enhance the course.”</p><p><img src="https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/assets/images/news/2020/03/ProfDonaClass_use.jpg"><br></p><p><i>Professor Roberto Donà, XJTLU's International Business School Suzhou,and his master's level Business Leadership course</i></p><p>Students in an elective, two-week online course taught just before all modules moved online were highly active, producing hundreds of discussion forum messages, noted Dr Qian Wang of XJTLU’s <a href="study/departments/institute-of-leadership-and-education-advanced-development/">Institute of Leadership and Education Advanced Development</a> (ILEAD).</p><p>“Seeing how actively students communicated and bounced ideas off each other in offline discussion groups was exciting and rewarding,” said Dr Wang.<br></p><p>Several of the educators interviewed have found benefits from online technology to incorporate in face-to-face classes in the future.</p><p>Live online sessions can be a good way to teach use of software, Dr Lo of SOFTA noted.<br></p><p>“I can use screensharing functions to demonstrate in a lively and engaging manner, and I can connect a digital drawing pad to my computer to literally turn my desktop into a whiteboard,” he said.</p><p>Dr Medina discovered a method to ensure students read material before lectures.<br></p><p>“Asking students to discuss pre-readings for lectures in online forums has turned out to be a good way to ensure accountability,” he said.</p><p>Dr Zhao has found that having students respond to his questions in a chat window during a live class has helped him narrow in on where to focus. <br></p><p>“I can immediately understand what knowledge points the students have questions about.  I can learn more directly what topics they need more information on and which they need me to explain from a different angle,” he said.</p><p>Professor Donà said he appreciates how technology can even the level of knowledge among students in a module.<br></p><p>“Instead of my taking 20-30 minutes to explain a theory in a class of 50 where some students already know it, technology can allow those who don’t to drill into that information via a computer application. I then have more time to spend doing individual coaching,” he said.</p><p>“Now that we have had this experience with online teaching, I don’t think we will ever go back entirely to the way we taught before.”</p><p><img src="https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/assets/images/news/2020/03/DrAnnaYTian_use.jpg"></p><p><i>Dr Anna Y.
