<p>Scientists at Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University have invented a unique soil solution sampling tool that could help ensure the safety of food grown on land once polluted by harmful heavy metals.</p><p><img src="https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/assets/images/news/2019/07/Zheng_Green rice field in asia at spring time.jpg"></p><p>Dr Zheng Chen from XJTLU’s <a href="study/departments/academic-departments/health-and-environmental-sciences/">Department of Health and Environmental Sciences</a> says the new tool could monitor soil contamination risks in the agriculture industry.<br></p><p>“A large amount of agricultural land worldwide is contaminated by heavy metals that can be harmful to people’s health, so engineers are trying to design methods to grow crops on these lands safely,” he says. </p><p>“If they were able to predict how a concentration of heavy metals in soil is linked to a concentration of heavy metals in the edible part of a plant, they could devise better ways to manage the soil. We hope our device can help them make that prediction.”<br></p><p>In addition to promoting food safety, he and his team believe the tool could aid farmers in growing crops more efficiently.<br></p><p>“We think this tool could be used to help farmers more accurately apply fertiliser by measuring nutrients in the soil around plant roots,” he says.<br></p><p>“While these uses for agriculture would need to be tested, we believe the tool has a number of applications which could lead to more efficient, environmentally-friendly practices.”<br></p><p>According to Dr Chen, the device is currently the best available to study distribution of heavy metals in flooded soils.<br></p><p>“Other tools easily disturb the soil being tested or cannot analyse the soil with the detail required in certain situations,” he says.<br></p><p>“Our tool has minimal risk for disturbing the soil, and can analyse a sampling zone at high resolutions – about two millimetres compared to the more-than-a-centimetre resolution offered by the previous method.<br></p><p>“Furthermore, our device can be used repeatedly and can measure changes over time.<br></p><p>“We might be the only group in the world who can measure heavy metals in high resolution at different time points.”<br></p><p><img src="https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/assets/images/news/2019/07/Zheng_Chen2.jpg"></p><p>The tool is currently being tested at Zhejiang University – the first use outside of XJTLU. Dr Chen (pictured above) says he hopes other scientists doing related research will also try it, which could lead to an expansion of its uses. <br></p><p>The tool features a tube made of special plastic that is inserted into the soil. The tube’s surface is porous, with holes so small that large molecules or soil particles cannot pass through.  However, the holes are large enough that heavy metal ions and small molecules can enter.
