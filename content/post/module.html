<p>UK degrees are three years long whereas in China they are four, therefore we do accept students with certain qualifications directly into Year Two, which is the start of the main academic programme. Most students, however, enter into <a href="https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/study/why-study-at-xjtlu/year-one">Year One</a>, which provides you with a range of interesting modules, language classes and core skills for your degree.</p>
<p>The modules for Year Two to Year Four are in the following table.</p>

<div id="overview" class="section level2">
<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>The BSc in Environmental Science programme gives you an understanding of the natural world and environmental problems caused by development. The programme combines biology, chemistry, earth sciences, mathematical, statistical and GIS methods into one subject. Specialized teams of experts work in biogeochemistry and environmental chemistry; soil, plant and animal ecology; and physical geography and geomorphology.</p>
<p>You will learn to apply problem-solving skills to some of the greatest challenges facing humanity today. Furthermore, you will gain field skills through participating in international field trips in coastal and mountain environments, learning about surveying and interviewing key community stakeholders.</p>
