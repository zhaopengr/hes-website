<p>Maede received her MSc degree in Natural Resources Engineering from Shiraz University, Iran. Her current project aims to understand the response of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal communities under different land management regimes, the impact on soil carbon fluxes, and the resulting net carbon sequestration or loss. This will be assessed in a longterm field experiment (&gt;10 yrs) by <sup>13</sup>C-CO<sub>2</sub> pulse chase labelling experiment. Furthermore, laboratory experiments will be performed on monoliths taken from the site to quantify how the different systems respond to drought imposition.</p>

<p>I obtained a BSc in Geographic Information System (GIS) from Suzhou University of Science and Technology, China, and a MSc in Urban Planning from Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, China. It opened up and horizon and sharpened my skills especially in areas like data structures and computational techniques to capture, represent, process, and analyze geographic information, and cultivated my ability to think rationally about the comprehensive integration of society, economy and ecology from a diversified perspective. </br></br> After graduating, I continued to stay at the XJTLU university research center, Urban and Environmental Research Center. Through one year of work experience to study the sustainable development and environmental issues of the city, using my academic background to explore the relationship and balance between environmental ecology and social development, I have better understood the progress and difficulties of social development. </br></br> Now my PhD project is “Trade-offs and synergies between biodiversity conservation and human ecosystem services”. The research aims to spatially quantifying variations in geophysical features, biodiversity, current land use, and current services provided to humans.</p>
