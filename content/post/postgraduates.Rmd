## MAEDE FAGHIHINIA

<img src="https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/assets/images/students/maede-faghihinia.jpg" width="20%" style="display: block; margin: auto;">Maede received her MSc degree in Natural Resources Engineering from Shiraz University, Iran.

Her current project aims to understand the response of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal communities under different land management regimes, the impact on soil carbon fluxes, and the resulting net carbon sequestration or loss. This will be assessed in a longterm field experiment (>10 yrs) by 13C-CO2 pulse chase labelling experiment. Furthermore, laboratory experiments will be performed on monoliths taken from the site to quantify how the different systems respond to drought imposition.
