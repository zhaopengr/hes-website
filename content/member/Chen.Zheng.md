### Profile

I am an environmental chemist and fascinated by the microbes mediated extracellular electron transfer. This is a phenomenon happening in any soils, especially flooded lands.  It is still a labyrinth but known to significantly impact the translocation and transformation of many pollutants, e.g. heavy metals, and petroleum.  Our labs are well equipped with state-of-art analytical instruments. We are also keen to develop our tools to resolve the processes in real soil/sediment system. <br>Contact me by emails if you are interested in joining us. <br>
