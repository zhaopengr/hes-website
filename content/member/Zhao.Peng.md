### Profile

Dr. Peng Zhao holds a Ph.D. in Geoecology (University of Bayreuth), a M.Sc. in Environmental Sciences (Peking University), and a B.Sc. in Chemistry (Peking University). He worked as an assistant research scientist at the Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences, a post-doc at the Institute of Ecology, University of Innsbruck, and a post-doc at the Max Planck Institute of Chemistry, before he joined Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University in 2020.<br><br>His research focuses on the ecosystem-atmosphere interaction as well as the cycles and transformations of atmospheric pollutants, especially carbon and nitrogen compounds.<br><br>He teaches the module "Statistics for Environmental Scientists" and "Methods for Analysing Public Health IV: Working in the Field: Data". Before he joined Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, he taught "R, Open Science, and Reproducible Research" at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, and "Routine Observation of Atmosphere" at the Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences.<br><br>He published the book "Learning R" (in Chinese).<br><br>More details can be found on his personal website: pzhao.org
