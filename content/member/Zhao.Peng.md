Dr. Peng Zhao used to work as an assistant research scientist at the Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences, a post-doc at the Institute of Ecology, University of Innsbruck, and a post-doc at the Max Planck Institute of Chemistry, before he joined Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University in 2020.

His research focuses on the ecosystem-atmosphere interaction as well as the cycles and transformations of atmospheric pollutants, especially greenhouse gases and aerosol particles.

He teaches the module "Statistics for Environmental Scientists" and "Methods for Analysing Public Health IV: Working in the Field: Data". Before he joined Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, he taught "R, Open Science, and Reproducible Research" at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, and "Routine Observation of Atmosphere" at the Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences.

He published the book "Learning R" (in Chinese).
